# FunWithLanguages
Basic notes and scripts across multiple programming languages

PURPOSE

This is just a reference repo with some code snippets across a variety of languages. The goal is to have one place where I have a bit of everything - a one stop shop to look for code examples in any of the languages I use for work or side projects.

The key thing is that it is all code I have written myself. Unlike some of my other repos I don't want to just copy and paste things here for later use. It is not meant to be a utility repo but rather more like a collection of notes.
